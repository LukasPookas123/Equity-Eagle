<p>ISTANBUL, April 7 (Bernama-Anadolu) -- US-based global tech firm Microsoft is imposed a total of US$3.3 million in civil penalties for its alleged and apparent violations of US export controls and sanctions laws, Treasury and Commerce departments said Thursday in a joint statement.</p>
<p>Microsoft voluntarily self-disclosed the alleged violations to both the Commerce Department's Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS) and the Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC), said the statement, reported Anadolu.</p>
<p>It added that the tech firm cooperated with the joint investigation conducted by BIS and OFAC, and took remedial measures after discovering the conduct at issue, which predated the export controls and sanctions imposed in connection with Russia's ongoing war in Ukraine.</p>
<p>While BIS imposed an administrative penalty of more than US$600,000 on Microsoft involving its subsidiary Microsoft Rus LLC, or Microsoft Russia, the company also settled with OFAC and agreed to an almost US$3 million civil penalty to resolve 1,339 violations of sanctions regulations involving Ukraine/Russia, Cuba, Iran, and Syria.</p>
<p>Microsoft was given a US$276,000 credit by BIS, contingent upon Microsoft fulfilling its requirements under the OFAC settlement agreement, according to the statement.</p>
<p>""US companies will be held accountable for the activities of their foreign subsidiaries,"" said Assistant Secretary for Export Enforcement Matthew S. Axelrod. ""As this coordinated resolution demonstrates, BIS and OFAC will work together to ensure that US export control and sanctions laws are enforced effectively, wherever in the world the underlying conduct occurs.""</p>
<p>Employees of Microsoft Russia caused another Microsoft subsidiary to enter into or sell software licensing agreements that would allow the transfer or access to software on seven occasions between December 2016, and December 2017, said the Treasury.</p>
<p>OFAC Director Andrea Gacki said Microsoft's case underscores the risks technology companies may face when engaging through foreign subsidiaries, distributors, and resellers.</p>

Wall Streetâs main indexes ended higher on Thursday, helped by a rally in tech stocks as investors looked ahead to Friday's jobs report. The Dow eked out a fractional gain, the S&amp;P 500 added more than 0.33% and the NASDAQ notched 0.75% percent rise. Shares of Alphabet rose after the Wall Street Journal reported the company plans to add artificial intelligence features to Googleâs search engine. Microsoft rallied with it, with the two tech giants providing more fuel than any other stocks to the S&amp;P's gain. But Wall Street has lost ground in recent days due to signs of a slowing economy. On Thursday, that included weekly jobless claims numbers that showed the labor market is softening. Hans Olsen, Chief Investment Officer of Fiduciary Trust, says he thinks a recession may be coming in the next six to 12 months.<br/>
<br/>
So, we still have time, but the trends seem to be gathering. Even recent data this week, the ISM data, the JOLTS report, I mean, these are all sort of tells that the cycle is in fact turning. And the labor market was the last market to hold up, which makes the employment number tomorrow so very important.<br/>
<br/>
The non-farm payrolls report, out Friday, is expected to show the economy added 239,000 jobs in March, down from the 311,000 jobs added in the prior month. Its release comes on the Good Friday holiday, when the market will be closed. Among Thursdayâs movers, Caterpillar, viewed as a bellwether for the industrial sector, saw its shares dip 2%, bringing its loss over the past three days to 9% . And Levi Strauss &amp; Co tumbled 16% after the apparel maker posted a fall in quarterly profit.</span></div>
