Wall Streetâs main indexes ended higher on Thursday, helped by a rally in tech stocks as investors looked ahead to Friday's jobs report. The Dow eked out a fractional gain, the S&amp;P 500 added more than 0.33% and the NASDAQ notched 0.75% percent rise. Shares of Alphabet rose after the Wall Street Journal reported the company plans to add artificial intelligence features to Googleâs search engine. Microsoft rallied with it, with the two tech giants providing more fuel than any other stocks to the S&amp;P's gain. But Wall Street has lost ground in recent days due to signs of a slowing economy. On Thursday, that included weekly jobless claims numbers that showed the labor market is softening. Hans Olsen, Chief Investment Officer of Fiduciary Trust, says he thinks a recession may be coming in the next six to 12 months.<br/>
<br/>
So, we still have time, but the trends seem to be gathering. Even recent data this week, the ISM data, the JOLTS report, I mean, these are all sort of tells that the cycle is in fact turning. And the labor market was the last market to hold up, which makes the employment number tomorrow so very important.<br/>
<br/>
The non-farm payrolls report, out Friday, is expected to show the economy added 239,000 jobs in March, down from the 311,000 jobs added in the prior month. Its release comes on the Good Friday holiday, when the market will be closed. Among Thursdayâs movers, Caterpillar, viewed as a bellwether for the industrial sector, saw its shares dip 2%, bringing its loss over the past three days to 9% . And Levi Strauss &amp; Co tumbled 16% after the apparel maker posted a fall in quarterly profit.</span></div>

""In other words, they may be waiting to see evidence of sales faltering before becoming more pessimistic.""</p><p>But, “our sense is that analysts won’t have long to wait to justify turning downbeat, even if the evidence doesn’t show up much in the first quarter reporting season that is due to kick off next week.”</p><p>Capital Economics expects a bigger peak-to-trough decline in GDP as a result of the recent banking turmoil, though it still sees this as being less than 1%.</p><p>This suggests that sales per share have lots of scope to ""falter soon, and for margins – which are still pretty high by the standards of the past – to be squeezed some more,"" Higgins said.</p><p>     </p><p>(Karen Brettell)</p><p>     *****</p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><p>SHRINKING U.S. FOOD BENEFITS TO HIT RETAILERS' TOPLINE (1206 EDT/1606 GMT)</p><p>The shrinking emergency food assistance for low-income U.S. households is likely to erode revenue for food retailers.</p><p>Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) benefits that ended on March 1, accounted for about 12% of food and beverage sales in 2022, Moody's Investor Service said in a note, citing the U.S. Department of Commerce. </p><p>The research firm believes the loss of emergency benefits will reduce SNAP payments by $35 billion to $40 billion annually, weighing on retailers' revenue growth in 2023. </p><p>Retailers like Kroger Co <a href=""reuters://REALTIME/Verb=FullQuote/ric=KR.N"" data-type=""ric"" data-ric=""KR.N"" translate=""no"" dir=""ltr"">KR.N</a>, Albertsons Companies Inc <a href=""reuters://REALTIME/Verb=FullQuote/ric=ACI.N"" data-type=""ric"" data-ric=""ACI.N"" translate=""no"" dir=""ltr"">ACI.N</a> and Walmart Inc <a href=""reuters://REALTIME/Verb=FullQuote/ric=WMT.N"" data-type=""ric"" data-ric=""WMT.N"" translate=""no"" dir=""ltr"">WMT.N</a> account for about 80% of all SNAP benefits usage, while discount chains Dollar General Corp <a href=""reuters://REALTIME/Verb=FullQuote/ric=DG.N"" data-type=""ric"" data-ric=""DG.N"" translate=""no"" dir=""ltr"">DG.N</a> and Dollar Tree Inc <a href=""reuters://REALTIME/Verb=FullQuote/ric=DLTR.O"" data-type=""ric"" data-ric=""DLTR.O"" translate=""no"" dir=""ltr"">DLTR.O</a> are also major users, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, Moody's said.</p><p>Still, Moody's expects supermarket sales to grow 3-4%, with higher prices compensating for lower volumes, while earnings are likely to grow 1%.     </p><p>Food retailers are well-positioned to handle the revenue loss from reduced SNAP benefits, Moody's said, as consumers continue to spend their disposable income on food since the pandemic. </p><p>Retailers that stock cheaper private label goods will benefit from consumers shopping for cheaper groceries due to spending and inflation pressures, analysts said. </p><p>The end of SNAP comes at a stressful time for consumers who are already struggling with rising costs.

  </p><p>     Adding <span class=""tr-strong"">to recent data hinting at a weak labor </span>market, initial jobless claims fell to a seasonally adjusted 228,000 for the week ended April 1, versus expectations of 200,000 claims.</p><p>The Labor Department's data from the prior week was revised to show 48,000 more applications were received.</p><p><span class=""tr-strong"">Wall Street has lost ground in recent days in reaction to signs of a slowing economy, including weak data on private payrolls and job openings earlier this week. </span></p><p>
    <span class=""tr-strong"">That marked a change from recent months, when investors cheered weak economic data on the basis that it might mean the Fed's interest rate hikes were working and that the Fed could ease up on its campaign to rein in decades-high inflation.</span>

    <span class=""tr-strong"">Interest rate futures imply traders are divided about whether the Fed will raise its target rate or keep it steady at its upcoming May meeting, according to CME Group's Fedwatch tool.    </span>
  </p><p>
    <span class=""tr-strong"">""The market is trying to decide whether the 'growth and recession' scare or the 'Fed hiking' scare are more meaningful to prices, and so it's waffling between whether a softening labor market is good news because it gets the Fed to pause in May or bad news because it means the recession is actually coming,"" said Ross Mayfield, an investment strategy analyst at Baird in Louisville, Kentucky.</span>
  </p><p>     Focus now shifts to the more comprehensive report on non-farm payrolls, which are expected to have increased by 239,000 in March, down from the 311,000 jobs added in the prior month.
